# [Machine Learning DevOps NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/school-of-ai) &nbsp;

This repository contains some my work from the Machine Learning DevOps Nanodegree.
The Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree program focuses on the software engineering
fundamentals needed to successfully streamline the deployment of data and machine-learning models
in a production-level environment. Students will build the DevOps skills required to automate the various
aspects and stages of machine learning model building and monitoring over time.
Educational Objectives:
Students who graduate from the program will be able to:
• Implement production-ready Python code/processes for deploying ML models outside of
cloud-based environments facilitated by tools such as AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, etc.
•	 Engineer automated data workflows that perform continuous training (CT) and model
validation within a CI/CD pipeline based on updated data versioning
•	 Create multi-step pipelines that automatically retrain and deploy models after data updates
• Track model summary statistics and monitor model online performance over time to prevent
model-degradation


## Course 1

### Introduction to Deep Learning

Introduce yourself to deep learning by applying style transfer to your own images, and gaining experience
using development tools such as Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks.

### Course Project: [Build a Neural Network](https://github.com/riched158/deep-nano/blob/main/Neural_Nets/Sentiment_Classification_Projects.ipynb) &nbsp;
Build and train your own Neural Network.
