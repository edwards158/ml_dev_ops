# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
This project deals with the refactoring of a notebook churn_notebook.py, this notebook calculates
likey customer churn from a kaggle dataset.  The completed project will include a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI) 


## Running Files
The project consists of churn_library.py.  This is the refactored version of churn_notebook.py
churn_library.py can be ran using:
```
ipython churn_library.py
```

This will carry out analysis and write output data to models and images folders.

churn_script_logging_and_test.py is the pytest file which tests the results of churn_library.py.  It can be run by:
```
pytest churn_script_logging_and_test.py
```
This carry out the tests and write test results to a logs folder.
